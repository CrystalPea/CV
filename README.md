## Pea M. Tyczynska

I'm a maker of art, and a web developer in the making. But mostly, I am a person, molded by a complex mix of circumstances, genetics, exposures and choices. I should write here how special and awesome I am, but isn't all life awesome and special and absolutely unique?
Ok, you probably have hundreds of CVs to plow through today, so lets set the philosophy aside for now and concentrate on what you need to know about me.

I am a graduate of English Studies with experience in, among others, translations, project coordination and general administration. I have spent last year developing myself as a visual artist, organising a succesful solo exhibition (Botanical Dimensions), and publishing a comic anthology with Dalston Comics Collective. Along the way I discovered coding and it became my new passion. Currently I am attending Makers Academy web development course. My goal is to get a job as a developer in a socially responsible company, to write lots of beautiful and functional code, and to keep learning and challenging myself.
