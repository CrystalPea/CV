## Pea M. Tyczynska

I'm a maker of art, and a software developer in the making. But mostly, I am a person, molded by a complex mix of circumstances, genetics, exposures and choices. I should write here how special and awesome I am, but isn't all life awesome and special and absolutely unique?  

Still, there is this thing about me that you might find interesting. Namely: I absolutely love coding! And not about any coding. What really tickles me the right way is writing the best software I can, to plan, to design, to solve problems, to constantly refactor and learn how to write better, more beautiful,clear and extendable code. I love to code in a pair, and I love coding alone, too. I love debugging and getting stuck, because problem solving is my second nature. The way that writing software unites creative thinking and logical thinking and feedback loops and teamwork makes it my dream come true and a new purpose.

Now for a bit of personal history: I am a graduate of English Studies with experience in, among others, translations, project coordination and general administration. I have spent last year developing myself as a visual artist, organising a succesful solo exhibition (Botanical Dimensions), and publishing a comic anthology with Dalston Comics Collective. Along the way I discovered code and it became my new passion. Currently I am attending Makers Academy web development course. My goal is to get a job as a developer in a socially responsible company, to write lots of beautiful and functional code, and to keep learning and challenging myself.
   
   
## Skills

#### Software Development

I discovered software development in Summer 2016 and since then I've been breathing and eating code. I started by learning Ruby. Soon after, I have been admitted to Makers Academy, a super intense and amazing practical software development course. At Makers, we learn by building fully working apps, so I'm confident in applying my skills in practical and independent manner.  

Languages I have worked in:  
- Ruby  
- JavaScript / Node.js  
- Swift  

Frameworks I have used:
- Rails  
- Sinatra  
- Express.js  

Principles that guide me:
- TDD 
- SOLID  
- DRY  
- Agile  


#### Graphic Design and Illustration

I started to draw at the age of 4 and never stopped. Being an artist is one of the reasons I enjoy coding so much and why I rarely get stuck: both skills require creative approach and both are processes of constant refinement.
Below please find a few recent highlights from my life as a visual artist:

- designed logos for [Schoola Hoop UK](http://www.schoolahoop.co.uk/), [Ectomo Psyco Circus](https://www.facebook.com/EctomoPsycoCircus/)
- created a number of designs for [Luna Skoom - Watford-based artist collective](https://www.facebook.com/pg/lunaskoom/photos/?tab=album&album_id=1101970643170243)
- Published [a short comics anthology](https://twitter.com/hackneylibs/status/751832705130754050) with [Dalston Comic Club](https://www.facebook.com/DalstonComicCreatorsClub/)
- Organised a succesful solo exhibition - [Botanical Dimensions](https://www.facebook.com/peaczek/media_set?set=a.1391655107526770.100000468810248&type=3)

#### Project Coordination

My experience as a Lead Project Coordinator has taught me how to coordinate projects, manage timelines and organise necessary documentation. 

- During two years of work for [Baltic Control]((http://balticcontrol.com/)) I have coordinated over 500 inspections, each being a three-phase project taking about a month to complete. It was all about honing my multitasking and prioritisation skills, and attention to detail.
- I helped to optimalise documentation process and to move company documentation from paper to digital database.
- I liaised with internal and external parties daily to ensure smooth running of the projects and to minimalise fallout from any conflicts.
   
   
## Projects

#### All my apps were developed using TDD approach.

**[Collective Playlist](https://github.com/CrystalPea/CollectivePlaylist)** - a Ruby Sinatra web app. It lets users build playlists together. Functionalities: Users, Requests, Playlist and Track adding.
**[Instagram Challenge](https://github.com/CrystalPea/instagram-challenge)** - a Rails web app which based on the idea of Instagram. It lets users sign up, post photos, leave comments and like/unlike photos.
