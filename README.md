## Pea M. Tyczynska

I'm a maker of art, and a web developer in the making. But mostly, I am a person, molded by a complex mix of circumstances, genetics, exposures and choices. I should write here how special and awesome I am, but isn't all life awesome and special and absolutely unique?
Ok, you probably have hundreds of CVs to plow through today, so lets set the philosophy aside for now and concentrate on what you need to know about me.

I am a graduate of English Studies with experience in, among others, translations, project coordination and general administration. I have spent last year developing myself as a visual artist, organising a succesful solo exhibition (Botanical Dimensions), and publishing a comic anthology with Dalston Comics Collective. Along the way I discovered coding and it became my new passion. Currently I am attending Makers Academy web development course. My goal is to get a job as a developer in a socially responsible company, to write lots of beautiful and functional code, and to keep learning and challenging myself.
   
   
## Skills

#### Graphic Design and Illustration

I started to draw at the age of 4 and never stopped. Being an artist is one of the reasons I enjoy coding so much and why I rarely get stuck: both skills require creative approach and both are processes of constant refinement.
Below please find a few recent highlights from my life as a visual artist:

- designed logos for [Schoola Hoop UK](http://www.schoolahoop.co.uk/), [Ectomo Psyco Circus](https://www.facebook.com/EctomoPsycoCircus/)
- created a number of designs for [Luna Skoom - Watford-based artist collective](https://www.facebook.com/pg/lunaskoom/photos/?tab=album&album_id=1101970643170243)
- Published [a short comics anthology](https://twitter.com/hackneylibs/status/751832705130754050) with [Dalston Comic Club](https://www.facebook.com/DalstonComicCreatorsClub/)
- Organised a succesful solo exhibition - [Botanical Dimensions](https://www.facebook.com/peaczek/media_set?set=a.1391655107526770.100000468810248&type=3)

#### Project Coordination

My experience as a Lead Project Coordinator has taught me how to coordinate projects, manage timelines and organise necessary documentation. 

- During two years of work for [Baltic Control]((http://balticcontrol.com/)) I have coordinated over 500 inspections, each being a three-phase project taking about a month to complete. It was all about honing my multitasking and prioritisation skills, and attention to detail.
- I helped to optimalise documentation process and to move company documentation from paper to digital database.
- I liaised with internal and external parties daily to ensure smooth running of the projects and to minimalise fallout from any conflicts.
