## Pea M. Tyczynska

I'm a freshly baked full-stack junior web developer. I'm eager to explore and learn new technologies. So far I have been building applications in Ruby, Rails, Javascript, Node.js and Swift. Please check my projects section to see some of the apps I've built.  

I think you'd like to know: I absolutely love coding! And not about any coding. What really tickles me the right way is writing the best software I can, to plan, to design, to solve problems, to constantly refactor and learn how to write better, more beautiful,clear and extendable code. I love to code in a pair, and I love coding alone, too. I love debugging and getting stuck, because problem solving is my second nature. My goal is to write lots of beautiful and functional code, and to keep learning and challenging myself.  

Before I discovered code I engaged in a variety of activities and gained lots of valuable experience. I developed strong communication skills by working in office environment where I liaised with internal and external shareholders everyday.  

As a visual artist I honed my creative thinking and design skills and understood my goals better. It also made me understand that I feel much better when working alongside other people than working alone. Publishing a comic anthology with Dalston Comics Collective and organising a succesful solo exhibition ([Botanical Dimensions](https://www.facebook.com/peaczek/media_set?set=a.1391655107526770.100000468810248&type=3)) were both collective efforts and at the same time highlights of my year.
   
   
## Skills

#### Software Development

I discovered software development in Summer 2016 and since then I've been breathing and eating code. I started by learning Ruby. Soon after, I have been admitted to Makers Academy, a super intense and amazing practical software development course. At Makers, we learn by building fully working apps, so I'm confident in applying my skills in practical and independent manner.  

Languages I have worked in:  
- Ruby  
- JavaScript / Node.js  
- Swift  

Frameworks I have used:
- Rails  
- Sinatra  
- Express.js  

Principles that guide me:
- TDD 
- SOLID  
- DRY  
- Agile  


#### Graphic Design and Illustration

I started to draw at the age of 4 and never stopped. Being an artist is one of the reasons I enjoy coding so much and why I rarely get stuck: both skills require creative approach and both are processes of constant refinement.
Below please find a few recent highlights from my life as a visual artist:

- designed logos for [Schoola Hoop UK](http://www.schoolahoop.co.uk/), [Ectomo Psyco Circus](https://www.facebook.com/EctomoPsycoCircus/)
- created a number of designs for [Luna Skoom - Watford-based artist collective](https://www.facebook.com/pg/lunaskoom/photos/?tab=album&album_id=1101970643170243)
- Published [a short comics anthology](https://twitter.com/hackneylibs/status/751832705130754050) with [Dalston Comic Club](https://www.facebook.com/DalstonComicCreatorsClub/)
- Organised a succesful solo exhibition - [Botanical Dimensions](https://www.facebook.com/peaczek/media_set?set=a.1391655107526770.100000468810248&type=3)

#### Project Coordination

My experience as a Lead Project Coordinator has taught me how to coordinate projects, manage timelines and organise necessary documentation. 

- During two years of work for [Baltic Control]((http://balticcontrol.com/)) I have coordinated over 500 inspections, each being a three-phase project taking about a month to complete. It was all about honing my multitasking and prioritisation skills, and attention to detail.
- I helped to optimalise documentation process and to move company documentation from paper to digital database.
- I liaised with internal and external parties daily to ensure smooth running of the projects and to minimalise fallout from any conflicts.
   
   
## Projects

**[Guide Me](https://github.com/aabolade/GuideMe)** - a Swift app that guides the user around an underground station using bluetooth beacons. Our app was built with blind and visually impaired people in mind. We used frameworks for iBeacon detection and for text to speech functionality. Guide me team comprised of 5 people, all Makers Academy students. My team mates on the project praised me for **"frequent strokes of genius"**. [A demo for the project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIF0KgibgrQ)  

**[Collective Playlist](https://github.com/CrystalPea/CollectivePlaylist)** - a Ruby Sinatra web app. It lets users build playlists together. Functionalities: Users, Requests, Playlist and Track adding. App was developed using TDD.  

**[Instagram Challenge](https://github.com/CrystalPea/instagram-challenge)** - a Rails web app which based on the idea of Instagram. It lets users sign up, post photos, leave comments and like/unlike photos. App was developed using TDD.  

**[Bowling Challenge](https://github.com/CrystalPea/bowling-challenge)** - business logic for a 10 frame bowling game which I have done in Javascript. App was developed using TDD.
